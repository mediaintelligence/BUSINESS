<a name="foreword"></a>Foreword on Market Opportunity
The artificial intelligence landscape of 2025 is not an evolution; it is a paradigm shift. We stand at the inflection point of a new industrial revolution, one driven by autonomous systems and causal reasoning. The market for agentic AI, valued at over $7 billion today, is projected to surge to more than $41 billion by 2030, demonstrating an explosive compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of over 41%. This is not speculative fiction—it is the validated trajectory of a technology that is fundamentally reshaping the enterprise.
Organizations that continue to rely on predictive models alone are navigating the future by looking in the rearview mirror. The challenge is no longer about forecasting what might happen but about autonomously deciding how to create the best possible outcome. This requires a move from correlation to causation, from passive analytics to active, agentic systems that can sense, reason, decide, act, and learn in complex, dynamic environments.
MIZ OKI 3.0™ was engineered for this new reality. It is the world's first Business General Intelligence (BGI) Platform-as-a-Service, designed to empower organizations to harness the transformative power of causal and agentic AI. This whitepaper outlines how MIZ OKI 3.0™ delivers unprecedented operational velocity, unlocks exponential ROI, and provides the strategic moat necessary to lead in the era of autonomous enterprise. The opportunity is clear, and the time to act is now.
