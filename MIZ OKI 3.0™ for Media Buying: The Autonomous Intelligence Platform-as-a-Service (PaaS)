#### EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: FROM AUTOMATION TO AUTONOMY WITH AUTONOMOUS DECISION CONTROLLERS (ADCs)
In 2025, the global AI market stands at $371.71 billion, projected to reach $2,407.02 billion by 2032 (MarketsandMarkets). Agentic AI, valued at $7.28 billion in 2025, is expected to grow at a 41.48% CAGR to $41.32 billion by 2030 (Mordor Intelligence). Causal AI is experiencing similar explosive growth, transforming how businesses understand root causes rather than mere correlations. Yet, enterprises face a $3.1 trillion annual cost from decision latency and data fragmentation (IDC Research), with traditional systems bound by predefined rules and human bottlenecks leading to delays, missed opportunities, and flawed strategies.

MIZ OKI 3.0™ revolutionizes this landscape as a Business General Intelligence (BGI) Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) on Google Cloud Platform, delivering true operational autonomy. Our core innovation—the Autonomous Decision Controllers (ADCs)—empowers the system to "think for itself" by autonomously deciding what to focus on, how deeply to analyze, which strategy to choose, how to execute, and what to learn. These ADCs govern the Enhanced Self-Healing Knowledge Graph (E-SHKG), a dynamic cognitive core that unifies enterprise knowledge and enables causal understanding via the Causal GraphRAG engine.

Operating through a SENSE-REASON-DECIDE-ACT-LEARN cycle, MIZ OKI 3.0™ achieves:
- **True Autonomy:** ADCs enable self-managing operations, with 94% decisions without human intervention.
- **Decision Velocity:** 50-75× improvement, reducing weeks to minutes.
- **PaaS Accessibility:** Zero CapEx, 2-8 week deployment, usage-based pricing ($10K-$50K+/month).
- **Causal Accuracy:** 89% predictions (3-5× better), addressing root causes.
- **Proven ROI:** 1,187% over 3 years; 128% ROI in CX applications (Master of Code 2025 stats).

With features like dual-level Mixture of Experts (MoE) and quantum-resistant security, MIZ OKI 3.0™ is future-proof, turning decision latency into dominance. This whitepaper outlines the platform, its impact, and your path to autonomy.

CHAPTER 6: YOUR PATH TO AUTONOMOUS BGI  

#### CHAPTER 1: THE DECISION VELOCITY CRISIS: THE NEED FOR TRUE AUTONOMY
1.1 The Failure of Correlation-Based AI and Rule-Based Automation  
Enterprises invest heavily in BI and AI, yet remain reactive. Correlation-based systems (67% accuracy) miss root causes, costing $50M in one retail case. Rule-based automation is brittle, unable to adapt without human intervention.

1.2 The Core Problem: The Absence of Autonomous Decision-Making  
Human judgments bottleneck every stage: sensing priorities, analysis depth, strategy selection, execution sequencing, and learning focus. This perpetuates latency in a world where 73% of opportunities vanish in under 7 days.

1.3 The Strategic Imperative: Moving from Automation to Autonomy  
With agentic AI growing 41.48% CAGR, organizations must adopt systems that autonomously manage cognition for agility and market dominance.
