## Executive Summary

### The $3.1 Trillion Decision Latency Crisis

In 2025, the global AI market has reached $371.71 billion and is projected to reach $2,407.02 billion by 2032 (MarketsandMarkets). Within this explosion, agentic AI is growing from $13.81 billion to $140.80 billion at 39.3% CAGR, while causal AI, valued at $53.24 billion in 2025, is transforming how organizations understand cause-effect relationships (Grand View Research).

Yet despite massive AI investments, enterprises face a staggering $3.1 trillion annual cost from decision latency and data fragmentation (IDC Research). Organizations using 137+ SaaS applications spend 40% of analyst time on data preparation rather than decision-making (Forrester), leading to devastating losses like $12 million quarterly from retail marketing delays.
