Executive Summary
In 2025, the global AI market stands at $371.71 billion, projected to reach $2,407.02 billion by 2032 (MarketsandMarkets), with agentic AI growing from $13.81 billion to $140.80 billion at 39.3% CAGR. Causal AI, valued at $53.24 billion in 2025, is transforming decision-making by enabling true cause-effect understanding (Grand View Research). Yet, decision latency costs businesses $3.1 trillion annually (IDC), exacerbated by fragmented tools and correlation-based insights.

MIZ OKI 3.0™ delivers Business General Intelligence (BGI) as a cloud-native PaaS on Google Cloud, powered by the patent-protected Enhanced Self-Healing Knowledge Graph (E-SHKG), five Autonomous Decision Controllers (ADCs), and Causal GraphRAG for 89% accurate causal predictions—3-5× better than traditional systems. Key benefits include 50-75× faster decision cycles, 94% autonomous operations, >90% self-healing data integrity, and 1,187% 3-year ROI (with 74% of AI deployments exceeding expectations, per PwC).

Applicable across industries, MIZ OKI 3.0™ reduces processes from days to minutes, as seen in healthcare (342 lives saved annually, $47M savings) and retail (+2.3% market share). With zero CapEx, 2-8 week deployment, federated learning, and quantum-resistant security, it positions organizations for the $50 billion+ autonomous BI market by 2030. Start with a free trial to realize value in 30 days.

Traditional vs. MIZ OKI 3.0™

Metric	Traditional	MIZ OKI 3.0™
Deployment	6-24 months	2-8 weeks
Cost	$5-25M CapEx	$0 CapEx, usage-based ($10K-$50K+/month)
Accuracy	67% correlation	89% causal (3-5× better)
Autonomy	Manual	94% agentic decisions
ROI	Variable, slow	1,187% over 3 years (92% in 12 months)
Introduction/Problem Statement
The 2025 AI Landscape and Decision Latency Crisis
The AI market is exploding: overall AI at $371.71 billion in 2025 (MarketsandMarkets), agentic AI at $13.81 billion growing to $140.80 billion by 2032 (39.3% CAGR), and causal AI at $53.24 billion in 2025 (Grand View Research). Yet, enterprises face a $3.1 trillion annual cost from data silos and delayed decisions (IDC). With 137+ SaaS apps per organization, analysts waste 40% of time on preparation, leading to losses like $12 million quarterly in retail marketing lags.

Limitations of Traditional Tools
Correlation-based BI tools achieve only 67% accuracy, often misleading (e.g., $50 million retail error from false links). Human bottlenecks add 12 hours/week per worker (Forrester), and without causal reasoning, predictions fail in volatile markets.

The Need for Causal/Agentic BGI
First-movers with sub-24-hour cycles grow 2.3× faster. Agentic AI (41.48% CAGR to $41.32 billion by 2030, per search) and causal AI enable autonomous, cause-effect decisions, capturing 47% more value.

Solution Overview
Defining BGI as PaaS
MIZ OKI 3.0™ is a GCP-native PaaS delivering BGI: unified knowledge, causal reasoning, and adaptive learning via APIs, with zero infrastructure needs.

Core Components
E-SHKG: Hybrid graph (TigerGraph/Neo4j/Vertex AI) managing 100B+ relationships, >99.5% entity resolution, >90% self-healing.
ADCs: Five controllers for autonomy (SENSE: attention scoring; REASON: analysis depth; DECIDE: strategy scoring; ACT: execution/rollback; LEARN: priority updates).
Causal GraphRAG: Traces causes for 89% accuracy, integrating temporal modeling/confounder detection.
Orchestrated Agents: Research Agents + MoE with learnable gating for agentic execution.
New: GenAI Integration for Personalization: Customizes insights using generative models, aligning with 2025 trends (Adobe).
S-R-D-A-L Cycle
Sense (prioritize) → Reason (analyze causally) → Decide (select ethically) → Act (execute) → Learn (improve) – achieving 50-75× speed.

PaaS Benefits
$0 CapEx, 2-8 week deployment, usage-based pricing, federated learning, quantum-resistant security (CRYSTALS-Kyber).
