Executive SummaryIn 2025, enterprises face a critical decision latency crisis. Despite massive data volumes, the delay between event and effective response costs organizations trillions globally. Traditional BI is too slow, and correlation-based AI is too shallow, leading to missed opportunities and flawed strategies.MIZ OKI 3.0™ solves this with Business General Intelligence as a Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS). Our patented platform doesn't just automate tasks; it achieves true operational autonomy through Autonomous Decision Controllers (ADCs)—sophisticated AI that decides what to sense, how to reason, and when to act.This delivers unprecedented results:50-75× Improvement in Decision VelocityA Proven 1,187% 3-Year ROIDeep Causal Insight, leading to 3-5x more accurate predictionsZero Upfront Infrastructure Cost via our GCP-native PaaS modelCapabilityTraditional Systems (BI, Narrow AI)MIZ OKI 3.0™ BGI PlatformDecision SpeedDays or WeeksMinutesCore LogicCorrelation & Predefined RulesCausation & Autonomous DecisionsDeployment ModelMassive CapEx & 18-24 Month ProjectsPaaS: Zero CapEx, Weeks to ValuePrimary OutcomeReports & AlertsAutonomous Business ActionsFrom preventing supply chain disruptions in manufacturing to optimizing media spend in real-time, our platform delivers tangible outcomes. In healthcare, our BGI system identified patterns indicative of sepsis, enabling early intervention that saved an estimated 342 lives in one hospital network over 12 months. MIZ OKI 3.0™ is the definitive platform for organizations ready to lead in the era of agentic AI.2. The 2025 Decision Latency CrisisThe cost of slow, uncoordinated decisions is staggering, estimated at $3.1 trillion annually in lost productivity and opportunity. This crisis is fueled by two factors:Tool Sprawl & Data Fragmentation: The average enterprise juggles over 137 SaaS applications, trapping critical data in silos and preventing a holistic view of the business.The Failure of Correlation-Based AI: Traditional AI mistakes symptoms for causes. In healthcare, this leads to an estimated $760 billion in waste annually in the U.S. alone. In business, it leads to ineffective strategies and misallocated resources.The market no longer rewards those who can simply analyze the past; it rewards those who can autonomously act on the present to shape the future. This requires a new class of technology built on causal reasoning and agentic AI.3. Solution: Business General Intelligence as a Service (BGIaaS)MIZ OKI 3.0™ is a BGI platform delivered as a managed PaaS. It is a unified, autonomous system that executes the SENSE-REASON-DECIDE-ACT-LEARN (S-R-D-A-L) cycle across the entire business landscape.Core Components, Delivered as a Service:Enhanced Self-Healing Knowledge Graph (E-SHKG): Your organization's dynamic "brain," unifying all enterprise data and knowledge. It autonomously heals and validates itself, ensuring peak data integrity.Autonomous Decision Controllers (ADCs): The core of our patent. These five distinct AI controllers govern the S-R-D-A-L cycle, making autonomous judgments about what to prioritize, analyze, and execute.Causal GraphRAG Engine: Our reasoning engine understands cause-and-effect, providing explanations grounded in logic, not just correlation.PaaS Benefits:Zero CapEx: Eliminates multi-million dollar hardware and integration costs.Federated Learning: Our platform architecture allows for privacy-preserving learning across tenants, meaning the core intelligence continuously improves for all clients.Quantum-Resistant Security: We provide future-proof security as a standard feature of the platform, managed entirely by us.4.
